50 MW Wind Power Project by Gujarat Fluorochemicals Limited, Gujarat, India
______________
The wind farm is owned by Gujarat Fluorochemicals Limited., (GFL- Project Proponent or PP), which is
a subsidiary of Inox Wind Ltd (IWL) and Inox Green Energy Service Ltd (IGESL)., which is a part of
InoxGFL Group. The InoxGFL Group is an Indian conglomerate with a legacy of more than 90 years. The
group is a forerunner in diversified business segments comprising Fluoropolymers, Specialty Chemicals,
Wind Energy, and Renewables in various geographies. The total installed capacity of the GFL Wind
Project is 50 MW wind power project in Surendra Nagar & Rajkot district of Gujarat. The GFL Wind
Projects consists of 25 WTGs of 2.0 MW each. The entire Engineering, Procurement and Construction
(EPC) are provided by Inox Wind Ltd & Operations and Maintenance (O&M) services are provided by
Inox Green Energy Service Ltd.

The generated electricity from the WTGs is grid connected wind power project located in various
village of Surender Nagar & Rajkot District in the state of Gujarat (India). The purpose of this plant
installation to supply electricity to regional NEWNE grid or wheeled for captive consumption
through wheeling into the grid and M/s Gujarat Fluorochemicals Limited (GFL) has the full
ownership of the project activity. The wind power projects are operational activities with
continuous reduction of GHGs, currently being applied for voluntary carbon offset units (CoUs)
under “Universal Carbon Registry” (UCR). The commissioning date of the first WTG
considered as the start date of the project activity and is recorded as 13/05/2011.

In the absence of the project activity, electricity would have been delivered to the grid by the operation of fossil
fuel-based grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new fossil fuel- based generation sources in the
grid. As is the nature of wind projects (renewable energy), no fossil fuel is involved for power generation in
the project activity. The electricity produced by the project is directly contributing to climate change mitigation
by reducing the anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs, i.e., CO2) into the atmosphere by
displacing an equivalent amount of power at grid.
